# A React+Redux template
Theme built with react calling WP-API for content.

## Why?
I wanted to play with the shiny new WP-REST-API, explore es6 and transpiling, and finally work on a full project using React+Redux.
note: you need to enable pretty permalinks...

**Existing features include:**
- Dynamic menus (main menu + footer menu)
- "Template pages" equivalence for [index.php, single.php, search.php, category.php](https://github.com/jackreichert/a-wp-react-redux-theme/tree/master/src/containers)... but in React/Redux
- Search
- Category archive pages
- First level sub-categories
- Tags
- Bootstrap 4
- Threaded comments
- Dynamic Head title tag

## How do I run Webpack?
- run `npm install`, or `yarn`
- run `webpack` or `webpack -p` (to minify)

## To Do
- Widgets
- Static home page
- Analytics reporting
- SEO
- more...
